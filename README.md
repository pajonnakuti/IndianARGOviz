How to Run the Dashboard
1. You must have Python installed
Python is the software that runs your .py file.
If you don’t have it, install it from the Python website.

2. Install the required Python libraries
Your dashboard uses some tools like Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib, and Cartopy.
You install them one time using a command.

3. Keep your dashboard file and data files together
Your dashboard code (argo_dashboard.py) reads two CSV files.
Make sure the file names and locations are correct so the code can find them.

4. Use Streamlit to open the dashboard
You run a simple command in the Command Prompt
streamlit run argo_dashboard.py
Streamlit will start the dashboard and open it in your browser.

5. The dashboard opens like a website
You will see your charts, maps, tables, and filters on a web page.
You can interact with the filters and see the results change instantly.

6. To stop the dashboard
Close the browser tab and press CTRL + C in the Command Prompt.

 Summary
